An optional argument is an integer representing the number of words you want returned after the nth word (the default value is `1`).

To parse the date from a Vertical TOS data string, for example, employ the following usage:

``` excel
=getNthWord("BOT +1 VERTICAL MRK 100 20 OCT 17 65/67.5 CALL @1.13", 6, 3)
```
This returns `20 OCT 17`.

=daysTillExp("1/19/2018", "2/16/2018")
```

<a name="getStrategy()"></a>
## getStrategy(trade_order, option_type)

Returns a string representing the option strategy of a TOS order. The first argument is a TOS order and the second is a string representing the option type being evaluated. The following usage would return `Long Put Diagonal`.

```

<a name="getPosture()"></a>
## getPosture(option_strategy)

Returns a string representing the market posture of a TOS order (bullish, bearish, or neutral). Arguments may be a string returned by the getStrategy() function. The following usage would return `Bearish`.

``` excel

``` excel
=getStockQuote("FAST","1/19/2018")
```

Note: this function is currently set to query stock quotes up to 2 years in the past. This can be changed by altering the Url variable to use a different element in the ranges array. Press `Alt+F11` to open VBA, select module1, and look for the `getStockQuote()` function. Possible arguments include:

``` vb
ranges = Array("5d", "1m", "3m", "6m", "1y", "2y", "5y", "max")
```

This function uses [iexcloud's API](https://iexcloud.io/console/search) to pull stock data. Alternative API's are available to use:

1. [iexcloud](https://iexcloud.io/console/search)
1. [Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/)
1. [TD Ameritrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/914q22/successful_access_to_td_ameritrade_api/)

Note: Risk only needs to be included to estimate max profits for calendar spreads.

The following is a list of formulas included in this function for calculating the max profit of currently supported strategies:

| Strategy | Max Profit | Formula |
|----------|------------|---------|
|[Iron Condor](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/iron-condor)| net credit received | Premium |
|[Butterfly Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/butterfly-spread)| distance between the short strike and long strike, less the debit paid | \| Short Strike - Long Strike \| - Premium |
| [Calendar Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/calendar-spread) | incalculable: occurs if stock price = strike price at front-month expiration* | ~Short Call Credit - Net Loss on Long Call |
| [Diagonal Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/diagonal-spread) | incalculable due to the differing expiration cycles | ~Spread Width - Premium + Extrinsic Value | 
| [Synthetics](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/synthetics) | undefined (unlimited) | Strike + Net Credit Received |
| [Vertical Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/vertical-spread) | distance between strikes less net debit paid OR credit received from opening trade | Spread Width - Premium OR Premium |
| [Short Call/Put](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/naked-options) | credit received from opening trade | Premium |
| [Long Call](#getMaxProfit) | undefined (unlimited) | âˆž |
| [Long Put](#getMaxProfit) | strike price less debit paid from opening trade | Strike - Premium |

Note: all euqations must be multiplied by the number of shares being controlled (# of contracts * 100) and subtract commissions.

\*Formula must use the Black-Scholes model to calculate the theoretical value of the Long Call when the Short Call is worthless. You make money on the short call and lose money on the long call. The key to max profit is making as much money on the short call as you can, and losing as little money on the long call as you can.

<a name="getRisk()"></a>
## getRisk(trade_order, option_type, qty, prem, max_profit[, comm])

Returns the risk calculated from a TOS order. The first argument is a TOS order, the second argument is a string representing the option type of the TOS order, the third argument is the number of contracts, the fourth argument is the premium per share, the fifth argument is the max profit calculated from a TOS order, and the sixth argument is commissions paid to your broker. The following usage would return `113`.

``` excel
=getRisk("BOT +1 VERTICAL MRK 100 20 OCT 17 65/67.5 CALL @1.13
","Vertical", 1, 1.13, 137)
```

The following is a list of formulas included in this function for calculating the risk of currently supported strategies:

| Strategy | Max Profit | Formula |
|----------|------------|---------|
|[Iron Condor](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/iron-condor)| the greater of the two vertical spreads | Spread Width |
| [Vertical Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/vertical-spread) | distance between strikes less net credit received OR debit paid for opening trade | Spread Width - Premium OR Premium |
| [Diagonal Spread](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/diagonal-spread) | distance between strikes less net credit received OR debit paid for opening trade | Spread Width - Premium OR Premium | 
| [Synthetics](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/synthetics) | undefined (unlimited) | âˆž OR Strike - Premium |
| [Short Call](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/naked-options) | undefined (unlimited) | âˆž |
| [Short Put](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn/naked-options) | strike price less credit received from opening trade | Strike - Premium |
| [Standard](#getRisk()) | debit paid for opening trade | Premium |

Note: all euqations must be multiplied by the number of shares being controlled (# of contracts * 100) and add commissions.

<a name="GetPlCLose()"></a>
## GetPlCLose(trade_order, option_type, prem, max_profit[, comm])

Returns the profit (or loss) of a closed TOS order. The first argument is a TOS order, the second arguments is a string representing the type of option being evaluated, the third argument is a string representation of the closing option premium, and the fourth argument is the max profit of a TOS order. The following usage would return `25`.

``` excel
=GetPlCLose("BOT +1 FAST 100 16 FEB 18 55 PUT @1.75 LMT","Put","2.00","5,325")
```

Numeric values are passed in as strings to avoid datatype errors when cells contain null values. They are converted to the appropriate datatypes _inside_ the function.

Many of the strategies in this function use max profit to calculate P/L Closed. As a consequence, commissions are accounted for. It only needs to be passed in for synthetics.


<a name="GetPlPercent()"></a>
## GetPlPercent(pl_closed, max_profit, max_risk)

Returns the profit (or loss) of a closed TOS order. The first argument is the Profit/Loss dollar amount, the second arguments is the max profit, the third argument is the total risk. The following usage would return `18%`.

``` excel
=GetPlPercent("43", "243", "257")
```

Numeric values are passed in as strings to avoid datatype errors when cells contain null values. They are converted to the appropriate datatypes _inside_ the function.

<a name="GetOptionSignature()"></a>
## GetOptionSignature(trade_order)

Returns the option signature of a TOS order. It can be used to chart the price of an option over time.

``` excel
=GetOptionSignature("BOT +1 VERTICAL MRK 100 20 OCT 17 65/67.5 CALL @1.13")
```

<a name="GetCommission()"></a>
## GetCommission(trade_order)

Returns the commission paid to thinkorswim for a fulfilled order. It takes a thinkorswim order to determine how many contracts are being evaluated. The following usage would return `$8.50`.

``` excel
=GetCommission("SOLD -1 IRON CONDOR QCOM 100 16 FEB 18 65/67.5/60/57.5 CALL/PUT @1.44")
```

The formula is as follows:

```msgraph-interactive
4 contracts * $0.75 fee per contract = $3 + $1.25 base fee = $4.25 * 2 for opening and closing = $8.50
```
