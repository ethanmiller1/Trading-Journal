> An Excel spreadsheet to collect and analyze institutionally traded stock and option data.

This spreadsheet was designed to (1) help track your trades throughout the year, (2) keep track of the market conditions surrounding the successes or failures surrounding your trades, and (3) keep record of the personal trading rules you applied to them to test whether they are effective trading rules or not.
